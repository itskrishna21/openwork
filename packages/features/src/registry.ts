/**
 * OpenWork feature registry: the one place a feature is declared.
 *
 * This is the file you edit to add a feature. Read
 * .opencode/skills/add-a-feature/SKILL.md first. Every new user-visible
 * feature, or a change existing users would notice, starts here, off, before
 * any feature code is written.
 *
 * A feature is rolled out, and reverted, along several dimensions:
 *
 *   deployments   which products it exists on (OpenWork Cloud, self-hosted)
 *   everyone      on or off for everyone on the deployment, changed in /admin
 *                 without a deploy
 *   organization  platform admins turn it on or off for one organization in /admin
 *   operator      a self-hosted operator locks it on or off for the whole install (Helm)
 *   kill switch   turns it off everywhere at once, outranking everything above
 *
 * The entry only declares what is fixed in code. The on/off state, kill
 * switches and per-organization overrides live in the database of each
 * deployment, and start from `default`. Run `pnpm features:sync` after
 * editing this file.
 *
 * Keys are permanent: the same name is the Helm values key, the
 * DEN_FEATURE_<KEY> environment variable, the API field, and the stored rows.
 * Use lowerCamelCase with no consecutive capitals.
