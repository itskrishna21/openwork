// Better-auth endpoints reachable over HTTP: every auth.api entry with a `path` and no
// options.metadata.SERVER_ONLY, one declaration per (method, path). They are dispatched by
// the `* /api/auth/*` catch-all (routes/auth/index.ts), so app.routes only reports
// "/api/auth/*"; the generic audit middleware resolves these declarations by the concrete
// request path (better-auth's ctx.path, e.g. "/sso/callback/:providerId", prefixed with "/api/auth").
//
// "handler" attribution here means a better-auth hook (src/audit/better-auth.ts, wired in
// src/auth.ts: hooks.before when the session and membership are verified before the endpoint
// runs, else hooks.after using ctx.context.returned / ctx.context.newSession) calls
// attributeCurrentAuditRequest through the request's AsyncLocalStorage state. Requests that fail
// before attribution (401/403/404) fall to the platform store. Rows attributed in hooks.after
// run after better-auth committed: intent and outcome are appended together and a failed
// append logs [audit-outcome-lost] instead of returning 503 (the session or row already exists).
//
