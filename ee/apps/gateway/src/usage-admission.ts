 * Decides, per request, whether usage limits are enforced for an organization.

 * When it returns `"skip"` ("usage limits off"), limits are **frozen and
 * unenforced**:
 *
 * | Thing | Behavior |
 * |---|---|
 * | Admission (`checkGatewayUsage`) | Not called. No limit or `openwork_gateway_accounting_unavailable` rejections from limits, including hard-limit-without-pricing and `coverage.captureEnabled=false`. |
 * | `X-OpenWork-Usage-State: blocked` limit responses | Never produced. Desktop quota plugins only react to rejection responses. |
 * | Request log, cost, rollups, spend reporting | Unchanged: written and readable. |
 * | `gateway_usage_tracking` capture flag (ops cutover) | Still honored by `startGatewayUsageLog` (`capture_suspended`, 503). It is an accounting safety switch, not a limit. |
 * | Policies, entries, assignments, subjects | Kept as is. Not evaluated. |
 * | Buckets | Frozen: no new charges. Requests made while off are never charged retroactively. |
 * | Reset requests | Kept. Pending ones expire by their normal rules on the next admission after re-enable. |
 * | Member lifecycle (`expireUsageRequestsForMembers`, entitlement mutation lock, org deletion erasure) | Still runs. |
 * | Turning it back on | Admission resumes on the next request. Open windows continue from stored consumption; ended windows roll over by the normal reset logic. No backfill. |
 *
 * With `"skip"` the request log row carries no `metadata.gateway_usage`, so
 * `startGatewayUsageLog` takes the attribution-less path and settlement
 * finalizes cost without bucket charges.
